 # Chapter: The Departure - When Hearts Collide

## The Truth Unveiled

The rescue helicopters had long disappeared into the horizon, their rhythmic beats fading like a distant heartbeat. What the other rescued women didn't know—what even Aadyami hadn't fully understood—was the devastating truth that had shattered Aanya's world.

Through careful conversations with other RAW operatives during the evacuation process, the pieces had fallen into place like a cruel puzzle. Aarav hadn't just been assigned this mission by chance. When intelligence reports confirmed that Indian nationals, including someone named Aanya from his college, had been kidnapped by the Taliban cell, he had personally requested the assignment.

*He came here for me,* the realization hit her like a physical blow. *He risked everything—his life, his career, his future—to save me.*

The boy she had rejected, the love she had thrown away, had become her salvation.

## The Bus Loading

The temporary military base buzzed with organized chaos. Rescued women were being processed, given medical attention, and prepared for their journey home to India. The large military transport bus sat like a green giant in the desert sun, its engine humming with the promise of freedom.

But freedom felt like a cage to Aanya.

She watched from a distance as Aarav coordinated the evacuation efforts, his now-familiar uniform of a RAW operative replaced with casual civilian clothes. Gone was the terrorist commander persona, but also absent was the gentle college boy she remembered. In his place stood a man hardened by years of sacrifice, his eyes carrying the weight of missions she could only imagine.

When her turn came to board the bus, Aanya planted her feet firmly in the sand.

"I need to talk to him," she told the military escort, pointing toward Aarav.

The soldier looked confused. "Ma'am, you'll have plenty of time to thank the rescue team once we reach India. Right now, we need to—"

"I need to talk to Aarav. Please."

## The First Confrontation

Aarav noticed the commotion and walked over, his expression immediately hardening when he saw Aanya refusing to board.

"What's the problem here?" he asked the escort, deliberately avoiding Aanya's desperate gaze.

"Sir, she's refusing to board. Says she needs to talk to you."

For a moment, Aarav's professional mask slipped, revealing a flash of the old pain underneath. Then it was back, harder than before.

"You need to go now," he said to Aanya, his voice cold and final. "You didn't want to talk to me back then, so what could you possibly have to say now?"

The words cut through her like shrapnel. The reference to their college days, to that final devastating conversation where she had told him to move on, hung between them like an open wound.

Aanya's eyes filled with tears—not the gentle tears of college sadness, but the desperate tears of a woman who had finally understood the magnitude of what she had lost.

"Please, Aarav, I just need—"

"Get her on the bus," he ordered the military personnel, turning away with brutal efficiency. "We have a schedule to maintain."

## The Escape

As strong hands gently but firmly guided her toward the bus, Aanya felt something break inside her. Not just her heart—that had been broken for years—but her spirit, her will to simply accept fate's cruel jokes.

*I won't lose him again. Not like this. Not when I finally understand.*

The moment the escort's grip loosened as he helped her up the bus steps, Aanya twisted away. Years of yoga and college athletics served her well as she sprinted away from the bus, away from the safety of the planned evacuation, away from the easy path home.

Behind her, she heard shouting, confusion, the sound of military boots on sand. But she didn't stop running until she reached the abandoned compound buildings where she knew Aarav would have to change out of his gear.

## The Vulnerable Moment

Aanya found him in what had once been the commander's quarters—a cruel irony not lost on either of them. The door was slightly ajar, and she pushed it open without thinking, her heart hammering with desperation and determination.

Aarav stood with his back to her, having just pulled on a simple white t-shirt. For a moment, the sight of him—no longer the terrifying commander, no longer the professional operative, just Aarav—made her breath catch.

He spun around at the sound of the door, his eyes widening in shock and something that might have been vulnerability before his defenses slammed back into place.

"What the hell are you doing here?" His voice was sharp, but she caught the tremor underneath. "Why aren't you on your way to India? Don't you want to see your parents?"

The raw emotion in that last question—the hurt, the confusion, the echoes of all the times she had chosen other priorities over him—made her heart break all over again.

"I want you," she said simply, the words falling into the space between them like stones into still water. "Please, just talk to me once. I have so much regret. If you don't want me, I'll go, but please... just give me this one conversation."

## The Rejection

Aarav's laugh was bitter, empty of any humor. "I don't want to talk to you. You just lost another chance, Aanya. Just like in college. Just like always."

The words were designed to hurt, and they found their mark with surgical precision. But instead of backing down, Aanya stepped closer.

"Everyone has gone. Every military member has left. How will I get home now?"

"That's not my problem," he said, but his eyes betrayed him, flickering with concern despite his harsh words.

"I'm happy here with you," she said, the truth of it ringing in her voice. "You can take me home. I don't care how long it takes."

"I don't have that job anymore," Aarav replied, his voice becoming dangerously quiet. "I left the service. After saving all the Indians, my obligation is done."

"After saving all Indians?" Aanya repeated, stepping closer still. "Or after saving me? I know you came here for me, Aarav. I know you requested this mission when you found out I was captured."

## The Breaking Point

The accusation hung in the air like a live wire. Aarav's carefully constructed walls began to crack, revealing the pain he'd been carrying like a weight in his chest.

"No," he said, but his voice lacked conviction. "That's not... I don't care about you. Not anymore."

"Then leave me here," Aanya said, her voice rising with desperate determination. "If you really don't care, then walk away. Let me go back to the Taliban."

She turned and ran toward the compound exit, her voice echoing across the empty desert: "Kidnap me again! Someone kidnap me again!"

The sight of her running toward the vast, dangerous emptiness of the Afghan desert, shouting for terrorists who might still be in the area, broke something fundamental in Aarav.

"Stop!" His voice cracked like a whip across the sand. "Just... stop."

## The Surrender

When she turned back to him, tears streaming down her face, Aarav saw not the girl who had rejected him in college, but a woman who had finally understood the weight of love and loss.

"Okay," he said quietly, defeat and something else—relief?—coloring his voice. "Fine. I'll take you home. But I think you're mentally weak from being in captivity for so long. I shouldn't be talking to you so roughly."

The apology that followed was rusty, like a machine learning to work again after years of disuse.

"I'm sorry."

Two words that carried the weight of years, of missions, of nights when he'd wondered what might have been different.

Aanya didn't hesitate. She closed the distance between them and wrapped her arms around him, feeling his body tense before gradually, reluctantly, relaxing into the embrace.

## The Journey Begins

"I was planning to explore this region anyway," Aarav said later as they loaded supplies into a military Humvee that had been left for stragglers. "Now that it's terrorism-free, I wanted to see what we'd been fighting for. Will you come with me? I don't want to risk you, but there's no one else here to take you to safety."

It was an excuse, and they both knew it. But it was also a beginning.

As they drove across the desert landscape, the silence between them was heavy with unspoken words and years of accumulated pain. Aanya sat carefully on her side of the vehicle, acutely aware of every breath, every movement from the man beside her.

## The First Crack

Hours into their journey, exhaustion finally claimed her. Without thinking, she let herself lean against Aarav's arm, her head finding the familiar comfort of his shoulder.

"Don't do this to me," he said quietly, but he didn't pull away. "I'm not your boyfriend. You should go to your boyfriend instead."

The reference to college, to all the other boys she had chosen over him, stung them both.

"I don't have any boyfriend," Aanya replied, her voice soft but certain. "Why would I go to another boy when I have the most handsome man in the world right here?"

It was flirtation, yes, but it was also truth—raw, honest, and years too late.

Aarav said nothing, but in the reflection of the windshield, she saw him close his eyes, his jaw tightening with the effort of holding back whatever he was feeling.

The desert stretched endlessly before them, vast and unforgiving, much like the distance they still had to travel—not just to reach home, but to find their way back to each other.

*In the vast emptiness of the desert, two broken hearts began the long journey toward healing. But some distances can only be crossed one painful step at a time.*

*The real journey was just beginning.*
