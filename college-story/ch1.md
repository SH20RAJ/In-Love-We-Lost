# College Story: The Beginning of Everything

## Chapter 1: When Love Was Innocent

The college corridors buzzed with the energy of new beginnings. First-year students roamed the campus with wide eyes and nervous excitement, trying to find their place in this new world. Among them were Aarav and Aanya—two souls who would unknowingly become the center of each other's universe.

Aarav was the quiet, thoughtful type. With his innocent eyes and gentle demeanor, he spent most of his time buried in books or working on coding projects. He had dreams—big dreams of creating something meaningful with his skills. But beneath his calm exterior lay a heart capable of loving with an intensity that would both elevate and destroy him.

Aanya was different. Vibrant, unpredictable, and fiercely independent, she marched to the beat of her own drum. Her Bengali heritage showed in her expressive eyes and animated gestures. She was the kind of person who could light up a room but also leave you wondering what she was really thinking.

They started as friends—good friends. Study sessions in the library, group projects, casual conversations during breaks. It was easy, comfortable, natural. Aarav found himself looking forward to these moments more than he cared to admit.

## Chapter 2: The First Confession

It happened on one of those warm college evenings. They were walking around the campus, just the two of them, talking about everything and nothing. The scent of jasmine filled the air from the college gardens.

"You know, I used to like Riya," Aarav had said suddenly, breaking their comfortable silence.

Aanya looked at him with surprise. "Really? I thought that was just a rumor."

"It was just an infatuation for a few days, maybe weeks. Nothing serious," he replied, hands shoved deep in his pockets, his innocent eyes reflecting the campus lights.

But Aanya was persistent, driven by curiosity. "But who do you like now? I think you like someone else. Just tell me. I want to know. Please, please just tell me."

He stopped walking then, turning to face her under the streetlight. His heart was racing, but his voice was steady. "Her name is Aanya."

"What?" She was genuinely shocked.

"Yeah, I like you. I love you, actually."

The confession hung in the air between them. Aanya's heart raced, but not with joy—with panic. "Aarav, I... I'm not ready for a relationship."

His face fell, but he tried to smile. "That's okay. I'll wait for you. I'll always be there for you, no matter what."

And that was it. Sweet, simple, devastating. The first rejection that would set everything in motion.

## Chapter 3: The Lonely Times

Months passed. College life continued its relentless pace, and gradually, Aanya found herself increasingly isolated. Her "weirdness," as some called it—her unpredictable moods, her fierce independence, her refusal to conform—had slowly driven away many of her friends. One by one, they found her too much to handle, too complicated to understand.

The loneliness crept in like a cold fog. She watched from the sidelines as groups formed and disbanded, as friendships blossomed and faded, feeling like an outsider looking in. The weight of her isolation became unbearable.

It was on one such evening, four months after she had rejected Aarav, that she finally swallowed her pride.

*I'm sorry.*

The message was simple, but it carried the weight of months of regret and loneliness.

## Chapter 4: The Unexpected Return

Aarav was walking across campus when his phone buzzed. He almost didn't check it—he'd been trying to move on, trying to focus on his studies and his coding projects. But something made him look.

Aanya's name on the screen made his heart skip a beat.

*I'm sorry.*

He stared at the message for what felt like hours. After ignoring it for a long time, wrestling with his emotions, he finally replied as if nothing had happened.

*What happened?* he texted back.

*Nothing, and by the way, sorry for everything.*

*You haven't did anything wrong to me,* he replied, adding a cute smiling emoji to make her feel better about him.

*I was walking and messaged you for that only.*

And just like that, he went to her. Because despite everything, despite the rejection and the months of silence, he still cared.

## Chapter 5: The Month That Changed Everything

They met that evening, and something was different. Aanya was vulnerable in a way he'd never seen before. The confident, independent girl he knew was crying, her defenses completely down.

"No one is my friend," she sobbed. "Everyone betrayed me."

They talked for hours that night. And then the next night. And the next.

What followed was the most beautiful month of Aarav's life. They were inseparable—hours of talking, late-night walks under the stars, playing Holi with colors painting their faces and laughter filling the air, endless phone calls that stretched into the early morning hours. They weren't officially together, but it felt like they were in a relationship in every way that mattered.

This time, Aarav fell deeper than ever before. This wasn't just infatuation anymore—this was soul-deep love that consumed his every thought.

## Chapter 6: The Second Confession

After a month of this beautiful togetherness, Aarav couldn't hold back anymore.

"Do you like me?" he asked one evening, his heart in his throat.

Aanya looked at him with those expressive eyes, and for a moment, he thought he saw something flicker there. But then she spoke.

"I don't know for now. I don't like you, but for the future, I really don't know."

He tried to hide his disappointment. "Okay, but I always want to take care of you. I think I see my future in you, that's why I wanted to say this." His voice was filled with deep emotion, raw honesty.

She shook her head. "I don't have feelings for anyone, and I will not have feelings for anyone. I'm too young for that. It's just the first year of college, and I don't feel what others feel. They are too mature, and I'm not."

## Chapter 7: The Betrayal

Time passed, and life seemed to settle into a new normal. Until the day Aarav saw her with another boy.

The sight hit him like a physical blow. All his friends had warned him—*Never trust any girl, don't fight for any girl, and especially not that girl. Never trust a Bengali girl.* Even his uncle had told him, *Bengali girls need at least two or three boys simultaneously—one for talking during the day, one for talking at night.*

But it was too late now. He was too deeply in love to listen to reason.

Out of obsession and hurt, he confronted her. "Is he your boyfriend? You told me you don't have feelings for anyone and you will not get feelings. You don't want a relationship. But what's this?"

Her answer shattered him completely.

"I think I like him, and I'm sorry about what I told you. That was a complete lie."

Everything he had believed, every moment they had shared, every promise of friendship—it had all been built on lies.

## Chapter 8: The Final Attempt

Days passed in silence. The pain was unbearable, but Aarav's love remained. Against his better judgment, he went to her one last time.

"I'm sorry for whatever happened. We can be friends, and I will never see you as someone you don't want me to see, until you want me to."

But Aanya was done with him.

"You don't have enough self-respect to move on. Just move on. I don't like you."

She cut the call and blocked him from everywhere—everywhere except calls.

A few days later, he called once, just to test if she had blocked him there too. She hadn't. Maybe she blocked him after that call, but he never called again.

He was done.

## Chapter 9: The Aftermath

The rest of college was a blur of recovery and reinvention. In his second and third years, Aarav created many friendships and seemed to enjoy life. From the outside, he appeared to have moved on completely. But inside, Aanya remained like a scar on his heart—healed but never forgotten.

Meanwhile, Aanya went through several relationships and breakups. Sometimes, when she saw Aarav around campus, she would deliberately show affection to whoever she was with, hoping to make him feel bad. But he appeared unbothered, indifferent.

The damage to Aarav's academics from that first year was significant. Love-struck and distracted, he had failed two subjects and received a very low GPA. But after the final rejection, something changed in him. He bounced back with a vengeance, throwing himself into coding and academics with an intensity that surprised everyone.

## Chapter 10: The Brilliant Exit

By the time they graduated, Aarav had achieved something extraordinary. His coding skills were unmatched, his academic performance exceptional. He received placement offers that no one else in their batch had even dreamed of—opportunities that would have set him up for life.

But in a move that shocked everyone, he rejected them all.

Five years after that first innocent confession under the campus streetlight, two years after graduation, Aarav simply disappeared. He cut contact with every college friend, left no forwarding address, and vanished into thin air.

No one knew where he went. No one knew what became of the brilliant, heartbroken boy who had loved too deeply and lost too much.

But somewhere in the mountains of Afghanistan, in the shadows of an Al-Qaeda compound, that story was about to take its darkest turn.

*Sometimes love doesn't just break hearts—it breaks souls. And broken souls, when left to fester in darkness, can become something unrecognizable.*

*This was how Aarav's love story began. But it was far from how it would end.*

*To be continued...*
